OGGCOIN ($OGG)
Development Progress Report
Date: February 28, 2026

Client Update Summary
The core Oggcoin ($OGG) smart contract is fully complete and all 15 test cases are passing on localnet — including security checks for freeze authority, PDA mint control, unauthorized access prevention, and unrestricted transfers. The remaining work consists of the devnet deployment scripts and the actual deployment to Solana devnet, which represents approximately 20-30% of Phase 1. Once deployed, manual verification and wallet integration (Phantom/MetaMask) can be completed immediately.
